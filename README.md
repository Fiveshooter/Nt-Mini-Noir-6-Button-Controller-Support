# Nt-Mini-Noir-6-Button-Controller-Support
Please download the zip file for information on how to get 6 button controller support on the Analogue Nt Mini Noir for use with the Genesis core.
The zip file contains information on what controllers have been tested working and links to an NES console to SNES controller adapter.
The zip file also contains a Genesis controller test ROM so you can test to check if all buttons are regestering.
Updated info 1/26/2024. The custom firmware is from Analogue and works with the 8BitDo Bluetooth NES Retro Receiver. I made no edits to the code in the custom firmware and take no credit for it's creation.
I've found very few Bluetooth controllers that will reliably connect to this receiver running the custom firmware. I'll add a document that can be updated with controllers I find to be working. Note, the 8BitDo M30 would not work for me with the 8BitDo Bluetooth Retro Receiver running the custom firmware. The Bluetooth version M30 paired with the 8BitDo SNES Retro Receiver while using the NES console to SNES controller adapter may indeed work. Assuming it does work, it lacks both a "menu" button and a "Select" button so may not be at all suitable for use. 
I am not the creator of the Genesis 6 Button controller test ROM. I'd like to give credit to the creator of this ROM however, I've yet to find the original source for the ROM although it is easliy found online under a few different names.
Please share with anyone you think may need this info.
Special thanks to Mistah MegaManFan for helping to get this info out to others.
