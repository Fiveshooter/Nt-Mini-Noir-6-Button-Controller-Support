# Nt-Mini-Noir-6-Button-Controller-Support
Please download the zip file for information on how to get 6 button controller support on the Analogue Nt Mini Noir for use with the Genesis core.
The zip file contains information on what controllers have been tested working and links to an NES console to SNES controller adapter.
The zip file also contains a Genesis controller test ROM so you can test to check if all buttons are regestering.
Please share with anyone you think may need this info.
Special thanks to Mistah MegaManFan for helping to get this info out to others.
